FAQ and contact information for KaBuddy

## Introduction
KaBuddy is a personal ledger based on the Japanese savings method kakeibo. Kakeibo (Japanese: 家計簿) is a saving method developed by the Japanese journalist Motoko Hani more than 100 years ago. It simply means **household ledger** und basically describes a way to manage your household finances. Kakeibo aims at arising awareness of your own comsuption habits, developping a sustainable, long term approach for saving money.



The basic principle consists of getting involved with **four** main question:
1. _How much income do I have?_
2. _How much do I want to save?_
3. _How much am I spending?_
4. _How can I improve?_

In order to help you understand where your income is going to, it's important to log and categorize **every** expense immediately:
1. **Needs**: things you really need (e.g. food, clothes, rent)
2. **Wants**: things you want, but don't really need (e.g. takeout meals)
3. **Culture**: things involving cultural activities (e.g. museum, books)
4. **Unexpected**: Non-anticipated expenses (e.g. health appointment)

## Quick Start

1. Enter your **income** for the month
2. Enter your **known needs** for the month
3. The difference between the two is your **budget** for the month
4. Based on your budget, set a **savings goal** for the month
5. Log everything you buy immediately under the four categories **needs**, **culture**, **wants** and **unexpected**
6. Get involved with the four basic questions of kakeibo and ask yourself what you can do better
